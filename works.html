            <h2>Historical Context</h2>
            <p>During the 19th century, the Philippines was under Spanish colonial rule, which lasted for more than 300 years (1565–1898). The Spanish government, in collaboration with the Catholic Church, exercised control over the country through a system of forced labor (<em>polo y servicio</em>), excessive taxation, and land monopolization. The friars held immense power, often abusing their authority over the people through unjust policies and moral corruption. Filipinos, especially the <em>indios</em> (native Filipinos), were treated as inferior and had limited access to education and government positions.</p>
            
            <p>By the late 19th century, educated Filipinos, known as the <em>Ilustrados</em> (intellectuals), began advocating for reforms and equal rights under Spanish rule. This movement, known as the <em>Propaganda Movement</em>, sought to expose the injustices and abuses of the Spanish authorities and clergy. Among its key figures were José Rizal, Marcelo H. del Pilar, and Graciano López Jaena, who used journalism and literature to campaign for reforms.</p>
            
            <p>Rizal, an <em>Ilustrado</em> himself, was inspired to write <em>Noli Me Tangere</em> to highlight the oppression and suffering of Filipinos. He wanted to awaken national consciousness and push for social reforms.</p>
            
            <p>Rizal's experiences growing up in the Philippines and studying in Europe greatly influenced <em>Noli Me Tangere</em>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Personal Witness to Spanish Abuses</strong> – As a child in Calamba, Rizal saw firsthand how Spanish friars exploited and mistreated Filipinos. His own family was harassed by friars over land disputes.</li>
                <li><strong>Martyrdom of Gomburza (1872)</strong> – The execution of Filipino priests Mariano Gómez, José Burgos, and Jacinto Zamora, collectively known as <em>Gomburza</em>, deeply affected Rizal. He dedicated <em>Noli Me Tangere</em> to their memory.</li>
                <li><strong>European Enlightenment Ideas</strong> – Rizal studied in Spain, France, and Germany, where he was exposed to liberal and revolutionary ideas about freedom, equality, and democracy. These influenced the themes of <em>Noli Me Tangere</em>.</li>

            <h2>Plot Summary</h2>
            <p>The novel begins with Juan Crisóstomo Ibarra, a young Filipino who has been studying in Europe for seven years, returning to the Philippines. He is warmly welcomed by friends but soon learns that his father, Don Rafael Ibarra, died under mysterious circumstances after being accused of heresy and subversion by the Spanish friars, particularly <em>Padre Dámaso</em>.</p>
            
            <p>Ibarra attends a dinner hosted by <em>Capitán Tiago</em>, the wealthy father of his childhood love, <em>María Clara</em>. At the event, he is insulted by Padre Dámaso but remains respectful. Despite the tensions, he rekindles his romance with María Clara, who was raised under the influence of the friars and her godmother, <em>Tía Isabel</em>.</p>
            
            <p>Determined to continue his father's advocacy for education, Ibarra starts a project to build a school for the youth in his town. However, the Spanish authorities and friars see this as a threat. His main adversary, <em>Padre Salvi</em>, schemes against him.</p>
            
            <p>The story culminates in tragedy as Ibarra is framed for rebellion, María Clara is forced into a convent, and Elias sacrifices himself to save Ibarra. The novel ends with a powerful message about the need for change in Philippine society.</p>
