  <main class="biography-content">
    <p><strong>José Rizal (1861–1896)</strong> was a <strong>Filipino nationalist, writer, and revolutionary</strong> who played a crucial role in the movement for Philippine independence from Spanish rule. Born in <strong>Calamba, Laguna</strong>, he was a <strong>polymath</strong> skilled in various fields, including <strong>medicine, literature, and the arts</strong>. He studied in the <strong>University of Santo Tomas</strong> and later in Europe, where he earned a degree in ophthalmology.</p>

    <p>Rizal's most famous works, <strong><em>Noli Me Tangere</em> (1887)</strong> and <strong><em>El Filibusterismo</em> (1891)</strong>, exposed the injustices of Spanish colonial rule and inspired the Philippine Revolution. Due to his writings and activism, he was <strong>arrested, exiled to Dapitan</strong>, and later <strong>executed by firing squad on December 30, 1896</strong>, in Bagumbayan (now Rizal Park, Manila). His martyrdom solidified his status as the <strong>Philippine national hero</strong> and a symbol of the country's fight for freedom.</p>
